# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on MNIST Dataset

**Project Description:**

**Introduction:**
The "Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on MNIST Dataset" project aims to create a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and serves as a stepping stone for more complex tasks such as optical character recognition (OCR) and digitized document analysis.

**Project Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to design, train, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The project involves the following key tasks:

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. This dataset is widely used in the machine learning community and serves as a benchmark for digit recognition tasks.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training. This includes data normalization, reshaping, and splitting into training and testing sets. Visualizing a subset of the dataset to understand the nature of the data is also part of this step.

3. **Model Architecture:** Design and define an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The architecture may consist of input, hidden, and output layers with an appropriate number of neurons, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. The choice of architecture can have a significant impact on the model's performance.

4. **Model Training:** Train the ANN model using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and features in the input images. Fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size is essential to achieve optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained ANN model using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be calculated to assess the model's performance. Visualization of model predictions and misclassifications can provide valuable insights.

6. **Model Optimization:** Explore techniques for improving model accuracy, which may include adjusting hyperparameters, increasing model complexity, or implementing regularization techniques.

7. **Deployment:** If desired, deploy the trained model in a real-world application where it can recognize handwritten digits from user input.


**Technologies and Tools:**
- Python programming language
- TensorFlow or PyTorch deep learning frameworks
- NumPy, Matplotlib, and other data visualization libraries
- Jupyter Notebook or similar development environment
- Git for version control

**Metrics:**
Accuracy: 97.55%

**Conclusion:**
The "Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on MNIST Dataset" project offers an opportunity to delve into the fascinating field of deep learning and computer vision. By successfully building and training an ANN model on the MNIST dataset, you will gain valuable experience in image classification and neural network design, setting the stage for further exploration in the exciting world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
